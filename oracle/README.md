An oracle server that returns the New York Times Wordle of the day with a Mina compatible signature scheme.

This is the oracle server backend for the [Mina Wordle Game](../README.md). It returns the New York Times Wordle of the day with a Mina compatible signature scheme. It uses `koa` HTTP middleware framework and `pm2` process manager for nodejs.

The oracle server runs on port `3000` by default.

## Demo

The following endpoints are available.

- [/wordle](https://mina-wordle-oracle.juxdan.io/wordle): returns the secret wordle of the day signed with the oracle server account.
- /wordle/\<date\>: provides wordle for a specific date. For example, [/wordle/2022-12-15](https://mina-wordle-oracle.juxdan.io/wordle/2022-12-15)

## Setup the configurations

The configuration file is `.env`. It should be placed in the root folder. A sample [.env.sample](./.env.sample) is provided as a reference.

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and add parameters for your setup.
